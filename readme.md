A simple Pomodoro timer built with a digital clock interface.
Default: 25-minute sessions × 4 per cycle, ✅
followed by a 5-minute break. ✅ 
Customizable durations, ✅
notification sound, ✅
and background music.✅

## 🚀 Next Features

A. **Store timer state in Local Storage**  
   Prevent the timer from restarting when the user reloads the page.

   1. Show the current work session index when a new session begins.  
   2. Notify the user when a full cycle is completed.  
   3. Display a countdown for the last 5 seconds of each work/break session (with a digital clock sound effect).

C. **Add confirmation dialogs**  
   Require a double confirmation before performing sensitive actions, such as resetting the timer or applying new settings.

D. **Add more background music options**  
   Allow users to select from multiple relaxing tracks (this time using APIs or embedded audio links).

E. **Enable YouTube music embedding**  
   Allow users to embed a YouTube music video link to play its audio as background music.
## 🧭 Future Roadmap

This section outlines planned improvements and new features that will enhance the Pomodoro Clock’s usability, customization, and overall experience.

### 🕒 1. Store Timer State in Local Storage
- Save the current timer state so it will not restart when the user reloads or reopens the page.  
- Ensure that the timer pauses and resumes correctly after refresh.

### 🔔 2. Toast Notifications
Add toast-style notifications to improve feedback and awareness during each session:
- Show the **current work session index** when a new work session starts.  
- Notify the user **when a full Pomodoro cycle is completed**.  
- Trigger a short **countdown (last 5 seconds)** with a digital clock sound before each work/break session ends.

### ⚙️ 3. Confirmation Dialogs
- Add a **double-check prompt** before performing critical actions such as resetting the clock or applying new settings.  
- Prevent accidental actions that interrupt a running timer.

### 🎵 4. Background Music Expansion
- Offer a wider selection of relaxing background tracks.  
- Integrate audio through **APIs or embedded links** for a smoother listening experience.

### 📺 5. YouTube Music Integration
- Allow users to **embed a YouTube music video link** and use its audio as background music.  
- Support play/pause synchronization with the timer for better immersion.
